What kind of information is stored in a hexdump?
ANS:
	Hex dumps could contain the following kinds of data although not limited to these. These are just to name a few :

	> a file read from a disk device
	> raw bytes read from a disk device (displaying the partitioning or filesystem structures)
	> something captured from a serial line
	> something captured from a network device (IP packets, Ethernet frames)
	> a memory dump
	> data captured from some communications bus (USB, I2C etc.)
